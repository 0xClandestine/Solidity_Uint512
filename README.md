# Solidity_Uint512

Solidity Uint512 Math Library. Supports addition (512 x 512 -> 512), subtraction (512 x 512 -> 512), multiplication (256 x 256 -> 512), division (512 x 256 -> 256) and square root (256 -> 256 and 512 -> 256). All functions are gas optimized as far as my knowladge goes. Feel free to contribute if you know more advanced algorithms, spot possiblities for gas improvements or just want to extend the library.
